## Reflection
How do I approach designing software? 
I approach software design with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and user-friendliness. I employ top-down design to break complex problems into manageable components, use modular design for reusability, and apply object-oriented principles to model real-world entities effectively. My process typically involves requirements analysis, high-level system design, component breakdown, and detailed specification before implementation. 

 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? 
This project has helped me refine my interface design skills, improving my ability to specify user interactions and system outputs. I've enhanced my architectural design capabilities, becoming more adept at defining major system components and their relationships. Additionally, my detailed design skills have improved, allowing me to better specify the internal elements of system components, including data structures and algorithms. 

 

What design process did you follow for your project work? 
For this project, I followed an iterative design process. It began with requirements analysis to understand the project goals and constraints. I then created a high-level system design for the 3D scene, followed by breaking it down into manageable modules. After detailed design of each component, I moved to implementation and testing. Throughout the process, I iterated based on feedback and testing results, continuously refining the design.  

 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? 
The design tactics I've used can be applied to future projects in several ways. The modular design approach can be used to create reusable components for similar projects, saving time and ensuring consistency. Object-oriented principles can be applied to model complex systems more effectively in various domains. The iterative design process can be utilized to continuously improve and adapt to changing requirements in any software development project. 

 

How do I approach developing programs? 
My approach to program development focuses on incremental growth and quality assurance. I use incremental development to build the program piece by piece, adding functionality with each iteration. Test-driven development is a key strategy, where I write tests before implementing features to ensure code quality. I also rely heavily on version control, using Git to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a history of the development process. 

 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 
While working on the 3D scene, I employed several new strategies. I delved into shader programming, learning to write vertex and fragment shaders for custom visual effects. Scene graph management became crucial for organizing 3D objects in a hierarchical structure, allowing for easier manipulation. I also implemented performance optimization techniques like frustum culling to improve rendering efficiency, which was essential for creating a smooth user experience. 

 

How did iteration factor into your development? 
Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. It allowed me to start with a basic scene and gradually add complexity, refining object positioning and lighting through multiple cycles of adjustment and testing. Each iteration provided valuable insights that informed the next stage of development. Feedback from each milestone helped guide improvements, ensuring that the final product met all requirements and exceeded expectations. 

 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion? 
Throughout the project milestones, my approach to code development evolved significantly. I became more adept at breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units, improving overall project organization. My code structure improved, with better separation of concerns between different modules, leading to more maintainable and readable code. I also learned to anticipate potential issues and design more robust, flexible solutions from the start, reducing the need for major refactoring later in the project. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
Computer science, particularly in graphics and visualization, is helping me reach my goals by enhancing my problem-solving skills through algorithmic thinking. It provides a solid foundation for understanding complex systems and data representation, which is valuable in many fields. Additionally, the skills I'm developing are opening up exciting career opportunities in areas like game development, scientific visualization, and virtual/augmented reality, aligning with my professional aspirations.  

 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
The knowledge and skills gained from computational graphics can be applied to my future education in several ways. It enhances my understanding of mathematics, particularly linear algebra and geometry, by providing concrete applications of these abstract concepts. It offers practical applications for theories learned in physics and computer science courses, making these subjects more tangible. Furthermore, the ability to create visual aids and simulations can be a powerful tool for learning and explaining complex concepts in various academic disciplines. 

 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? 
In my future professional pathway, the skills gained from computational graphics and visualizations can be applied in numerous ways. I can develop interactive data visualizations for business intelligence, helping companies make data-driven decisions. These skills enable me to create immersive training simulations for various industries, enhancing learning experiences. Additionally, I can design user interfaces that effectively communicate complex information, which is valuable in fields ranging from software development to scientific research. These capabilities make me a versatile professional, ready to tackle visual computing challenges across different sectors.
